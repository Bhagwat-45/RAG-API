Kubernetes (K8s): Complete Overview
1. What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It automates the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications.

Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure (VMs, bare metal, cloud) and provides a consistent, declarative way to run applications at scale.

2. Why Kubernetes Exists

Before Kubernetes, containerized apps were usually:

Manually deployed

Hard to scale

Difficult to recover from failures

Tightly coupled to infrastructure

Kubernetes solves these problems by:

Automatically restarting failed containers

Distributing workloads across nodes

Scaling applications up/down

Managing service discovery and networking

Enabling rolling updates and rollbacks

3. Core Kubernetes Architecture

A Kubernetes cluster consists of Control Plane components and Worker Nodes.

Control Plane (Master Node)

Responsible for managing the cluster.

kube-apiserver

Entry point for all REST commands

Validates and processes API requests

etcd

Distributed key-value store

Stores cluster state and configuration

kube-scheduler

Assigns Pods to nodes based on resources and constraints

kube-controller-manager

Runs controllers (Node, ReplicaSet, Job, etc.)

Ensures desired state matches actual state

Worker Nodes

Run application workloads.

kubelet

Communicates with the API server

Ensures containers are running as defined

Container Runtime

Docker, containerd, or CRI-O

kube-proxy

Manages networking and service routing

4. Key Kubernetes Objects
Pod

Smallest deployable unit

One or more containers sharing:

Network namespace

Storage volumes

ReplicaSet

Ensures a specified number of Pods are running

Used by Deployments

Deployment

Manages stateless applications

Supports:

Rolling updates

Rollbacks

Scaling

StatefulSet

Manages stateful applications

Stable network identity and persistent storage

Used for databases like MySQL, Kafka

DaemonSet

Runs a Pod on every node

Common for logging and monitoring agents

Job & CronJob

Job: Runs a task to completion

CronJob: Scheduled Jobs

5. Services & Networking
Service

Provides stable networking for Pods.

Types:

ClusterIP – internal access

NodePort – exposes service on node IP

LoadBalancer – cloud provider load balancer

ExternalName – maps to external DNS

Ingress

Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access

Works with Ingress Controllers (NGINX, Traefik)

Supports routing, TLS, and host-based rules

6. Storage in Kubernetes
Volumes

Ephemeral or persistent

Shared between containers in a Pod

PersistentVolume (PV)

Represents physical storage

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

Request for storage by a Pod

Supports:

NFS

AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk

CSI (Container Storage Interface)

7. Configuration & Secrets
ConfigMap

Stores non-sensitive configuration data

Injected via environment variables or files

Secret

Stores sensitive data (passwords, tokens)

Base64 encoded

Can be encrypted at rest

8. Scaling & Self-Healing
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

Scales Pods based on:

CPU

Memory

Custom metrics

Self-Healing Features

Restart failed containers

Reschedule Pods on healthy nodes

Replace terminated Pods automatically

9. Deployment Strategies

Rolling Update (default)

Recreate

Blue-Green Deployment

Canary Deployment

Kubernetes enables zero-downtime deployments when configured correctly.

10. Security in Kubernetes

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Namespaces for isolation

Network Policies for traffic control

Pod Security Standards

Secrets management

Image scanning & admission controllers

11. Observability & Monitoring

Common tools:

Prometheus – metrics

Grafana – dashboards

ELK / EFK Stack – logging

Jaeger – distributed tracing

Kubernetes exposes metrics via the Metrics Server and APIs.

12. Kubernetes Ecosystem

Popular tools:

Helm – package manager

Kustomize – configuration customization

Argo CD / Flux – GitOps

Istio / Linkerd – service mesh

Kubectl – CLI tool

13. Where Kubernetes Is Used

Microservices architectures

CI/CD pipelines

Cloud-native applications

Hybrid & multi-cloud deployments

Large-scale distributed systems

Used by companies like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, and Amazon.

14. Advantages & Challenges
Advantages

High availability

Scalability

Vendor neutrality

Declarative configuration

Strong community support

Challenges

Steep learning curve

Complex networking

Requires operational maturity

15. Summary

Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration, providing powerful tools to deploy, manage, and scale applications reliably. While complex, it enables organizations to build resilient, scalable, and cloud-agnostic systems when used correctly.
